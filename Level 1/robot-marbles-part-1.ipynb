    "cadCAD is a Python library for running simulations of complex systems.  \n",
    "cadCAD can simulate any system that can be described as state variables that evolve over time according to a set of equations.  \n",
    "If those equations are not deterministic (ie. if there's some random component to them), cadCAD can run Monte Carlo simulations of the system."

    "# State Variables\n",
    "A state variable is one of the set of variables that are used to describe the mathematical \"state\" of a dynamical system. cadCAD can handle state variables of any Python data type. It is up to the user of cadCAD to determine the state variables needed to sufficiently accurately describe the system they are interested in.\n",

    "We can describe the simple system in our example with only two state variables: the number of marbles in `box_A` and in `box_B`. These are not the only two variables that describe the system, of course. Things like the position of the robot arm in space or its temperature also qualify as \"variables that describe the state of the system\". But, as per the description of the example, we are not interested in monitoring those variables.  \n",

    "Computer simulations run in discrete time:\n",
    ">Discrete time views values of variables as occurring at distinct, separate \"points in time\", or equivalently as being unchanged throughout each non-zero region of time (\"time period\")â€”that is, time is viewed as a discrete variable. Thus a non-time variable jumps from one value to another as time moves from one time period to the next. This view of time corresponds to a digital clock that gives a fixed reading of 10:37 for a while, and then jumps to a new fixed reading of 10:38, etc. [_(source: Wikipedia)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time_and_continuous_time)\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Timestep in cadCAD refers to a discrete unit of time. cadCAD increments a \"time counter\", and at each step it updates the state variables according to the equations that describe the system. If time itself is a state variable that the user is interested in keeping track of, they may specify a state update function that models the passing of time. We'll cover that scenario in an upcoming article. For the moment, it suffices to define that the robot acts once per timestep."

We'll ignore the other arguments for now. `s` is a Python `dict` where the `dict_keys` are the __names of the variables__ and the `dict_values` are their __current values__.
